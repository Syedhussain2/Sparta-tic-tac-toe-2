**Challenges**

I need to get a better understanding of the fundamentals, and where to use which data-type, approach towards a problem needs working on aswell, for example research method needs to improve.

Working in pairs really helpful it help how someone approaches. Revise fundamentals, and rather then trying to picture the whole game, work on the building blocks.
